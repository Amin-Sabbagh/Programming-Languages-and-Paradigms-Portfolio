# Programming Languages and Paradigms Portfolio Piece

This repository showcases this project I have completed during my final year at university, worth 15 credits. I was taught 11 programming units and chose three to implement my solution.


### Assessment Overview

The unit was 100% coursework based, weighted at 100% of the unit marks. In summary:
- **Proposal of a Novel Task:**
  - Solutions for this task should not be easily available online.
- **Development of Three Solutions:**
  - Use different programming languages and paradigms for each solution.
  - Each solution must exhibit a range of paradigmatic features.
  - Each solution must use a unique programming language.
- **Documentation for Each Solution:**
  - (a) The name of the language and paradigm used.
  - (c) A short description explaining how the code completes the task and fits the named paradigm.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Uniquely proposed task description.
  - A folder containing three subdirectories, one per language.
  

### Task Description

**Introduction of the Game:**

The story unfolds as an epic adventure, drawing inspiration from the 'Hero's Journey' narrative framework. Our protagonist is summoned to embark on a perilous quest, driven by a profound personal tragedy, with the goal of dethroning a tyrannical king. To attain victory, they must navigate through three distinct cities and ultimately breach the king's heavily fortified castle.

For this project, I've chosen to develop a text-based game, lending a unique touch to the narrative. The game operates on a permadeath system, meaning that if the player loses at any point in the game, they must start over. This feature adds an element of challenge and excitement to the game, making it even more enjoyable to conquer. Additionally, each level offers both a positive and a negative outcome with four bad endings, one normal, and one amazing ending. This results in a total of six possible endings. In every program, enemies will feature a distinctive method of defeat.

### Solutions

#### Python - Procedural Paradigm

**Reasons for Choosing Python:**
- Ease of writing and reading, aligning with the procedural paradigm.
- Widespread adoption in the AI industry
- Programming in Python is enjoyable due to its simplicity and versatility.

**Approach:**
- The game will be modularized, breaking down the game logic into distinct procedures and modules.
- Enhances readability and maintainability of the code.
- Allows the game to follow a story-like progression through the four levels.
- Procedures for the Hero and enemies, including a 'take damage' mechanism.

#### Rust – Object Oriented Paradigm

**Reasons for Choosing Rust:**
- Enhanced readability and writability of the language.

**Approach:**
- Utilize Rust's object-oriented capabilities to encapsulate the game's logic.
- Use structs (classes) and methods for behavior, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Represent game levels using Enum values, with different parts of the story told based on the selected Enum.

#### Go – Imperative Paradigm

**Reasons for Choosing Go:**
- Modern and beginner-friendly, especially for the imperative paradigm.
- Conciseness and improved readability of code.
- Efficient development process with clear and comprehensible logic and mechanics.

**Approach:**
- Focus on logic and state transitions crucial for a text-based game.
- Embrace the imperative programming paradigm's top-down scripting.
- Adapt and implement imperative approaches in the game development process.
